## Description

Lute is an order management assistant here to help you manage your orders. Check Lute out
live [here](https://lute-client.onrender.com)

## Features

With Lute, you are able to

- Create an order
- Update an order
- View the details of an order
- View list of all orders.

## Development

The Lute codebase is a monorepo managed with Yarn workspaces. The 2 workspaces being `client` and `server`.

To run the codebase locally, you'll need

- A firebase project created and set up. Then provide the `serviceAccountKey.json` in the root of the project directory,
  This enables the server initialize the firebase project.
- An `.env` file in the root of the project directory. The variables to be filled in are shown in the `.env.example`
  file.
- run `yarn install` from the root of the folder directory for yarn to set up dependencies for both workspaces
- run `yarn dev` to start both servers and access
    - the client: `http://localhost:1234`
    - the graphql playground: `http://localhost:4000/graphql`

NB:

- Both workspaces share the same `schema.graphql` file. separate Codegen commands generates types for each workspace.
  Should the `schema.graphql` be updated, Codegen will need to be run for both workspaces
  From the root of the project
    - for server: `yarn run codegen-server`
    - for client: `yarn run codegen-client`

## Testing

Testing is configured for both client and server however the code coverage displayed on the repo is from the client's
cypress based end-to-end tests, which is where most of the testing efforts were directed.

To run tests locally, from the root of the project, run `yarn run cypress:test-dev`.
